*My first task is about Implementing "Caesar Cipher algorithm" that can encrypt and decrypt the text.

Caesar Cipher: Overview
A Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of +3, A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. Wrapping around: Z becomes C.

Key Features:

1.Encryption and Decryption support.

2.Supports upper and lower case letters.

3.Ignores non-alphabetic characters (punctuation, numbers, etc.).

4.Configurable shift key (positive integer).

5.Easy to integrate or use in scripts or console apps.
